============

the first repository to introduce the reason why i come to github:

1. github hosts so many open source projects in which I could join to improve my code level
2. so many genius are on this platform, working with them is a hornor and incentive to me
3. github will improve our project managent so much, also I am willing to try something new and fun 
4. this is a proof -- I will do better and make big progress!
